// Service + NetworkPolicy) or Docker primitives (container + named volumes +
// published ports). The orchestrator does not interpret the content — every
// workload-specific decision (which env vars, which probe ports, which
// affinity) is encoded here by the caller.
//
// The spec is the only payload `Apply` accepts. Domain layers (OpenClaw, the
// browser provider) build a WorkloadSpec from their own data and hand it to
// the orchestrator. The orchestrator stays workload-agnostic.
