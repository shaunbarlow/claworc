# Claworc - OpenClaw Orchestrator

Claworc is a web-based dashboard for managing multiple OpenClaw instances running in Kubernetes or Docker. 
It provides a unified interface to create, configure, monitor, start, stop, and delete bot instances, each 
running in its own isolated pod with a Google Chrome browser accessible via VNC.

## Why Claworc?

Companies need to manage AI agents at scale, so every employee and every team could have their own instances. 
Claworc replaces this manual approach by:

- Managing OpenClaw instances from a single dashboard
- Dynamically provisioning Kubernetes resources (Deployments, PVCs, Secrets, ConfigMaps, Services)
- Providing per-instance configuration editing with a JSON editor
- Offering global API key management with per-instance overrides
- Exposing each instance via dual VNC sessions (Chrome + Terminal)
